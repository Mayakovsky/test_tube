         and mid-dark skin, scarred in places. He was only medium tall but his height was emphasised by his thinness. If his physiology was the same as a Sichultian’s then the slight bagginess
         about his face implied the weight loss had been recent and rapid. His clothes were dark, perhaps black: skinny trews and a
         tight-fitting shirt or jacket, partially closed at the neck by a thumb-sized, blood-red glittering jewel on a loosened choker.
      
      
      Lededje saw him look at her right hand and so put it out to him. His hand clasped her hand, fingers with too many joints closing
         around like a bony cage. His touch felt very warm, almost feverish, though perfectly dry, like paper. She saw him wince and
         noticed that two of his fingers were crudely splinted together with a small piece of wood or plastic and what looked like
         a piece of knotted rag. Somehow the wince didn’t travel all the way to his face, which regarded her without obvious expression.
      
      
      “Good evening,” Lededje said.
      
      “Ms. Y’breq.” His voice sounded dry and cold. He nodded at Jolicci then indicated the seats on either side of him. “Wheloube,
         Emmis. If you would.”
