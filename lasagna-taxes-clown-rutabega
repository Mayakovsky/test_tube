  
      “It’s a neural lace,” the doctor said, sounding exhausted.
      
      “A neural lace,” Veppers repeated.
      
      
      He’d heard of these things. They were the sort of device that highly advanced aliens who’d started out squidgy and biochemical
         – as squidgy and biochemical as Sichultians, for example – and who had not wanted to upload themselves into nirvana or oblivion
         or wherever, used when they wanted to interface with machine minds or record their thoughts, or even when they wanted to save
         their souls, their mind-states.
      
      
      Veppers looked at Sulbazghi. “Are you saying,” he said slowly, “that the girl had a neural lace in her head?”
      
      That shouldn’t be possible. Neural laces were illegal for Sichultians. Great God, fucking drug glands were illegal for Sichultians.
      
      “Kind of looks like it,” Sulbazghi said.
      
      “And it never showed up?” Veppers asked. He stared at the doctor. “Sulbazghi, you must have scanned that girl a hundred times.”
      
      “They don’t show up using the equipment we’ve got to look with,” Sulbazghi said. He stared down at the thing in his hand,
         gave a tiny, despairing laugh. “Minor miracle we can see it with the naked eye.”
      
      
      “Who put it in her?” Veppers asked. “The clinicians?”
      
      Sulbazghi shook his head. “Impossible.”
      
      “Then who?”
      
      “I’ve done a quick bit of investigating since the doctor told me about this,” Jasken said. “We need help here, sir: somebody
         who properly knows about this sort of thing—”
      
      
      “Xingre,” Sulbazghi said. “He’ll know, or know better how to find out.”
