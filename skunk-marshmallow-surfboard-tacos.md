      The planet outside was very big and blue and white and bright. It was revolving, like planets usually did, but you couldn’t
         really see that on normal-time sight. It only seemed to move because the place where he was was moving. The place where he
         was was separate from the planet and it was moving. It was above the planet and it was moving. The place where he was was
         called an Abandoned Space Factory and he was here to wait for the enemy to come and when they came he would fight them. That
         was what he did; he fought. He had been built to fight. What he was, the thing that he was inside; that had been built to
         fight.
      
      
      The thing he was in was a thing, an “it,” but he was not an “it”; he was a he. He was a man. Or he had been, at least. He
         was still who he was but he was also inside the thing, the machine that was designed and built to fight and perhaps get destroyed.
         But not him. He wouldn’t be destroyed. He was still who he was. He was somewhere else as well, and that was where he would wake up, if this thing he was in was destroyed. That was how it worked.
      
      
      “Vatueil? Captain Vatueil?”
      
      They were talking to him again.
