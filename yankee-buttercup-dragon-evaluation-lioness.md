      There was nothing worse, Veppers thought, than a loser who’d made it. It was just part of the way things worked – part of the
         complexity of life, he supposed – that sometimes somebody who absolutely deserved nothing more than to be one of the downtrodden,
         the oppressed, the dregs of society, lucked out into a position of wealth, power and admiration.
      
      
      At least people who were natural winners knew how to carry themselves in their pomp, whether their ascendancy had come through
         the luck of being born rich and powerful or the luck of being born ambitious and capable. Losers who’d made it always let
         the side down. Veppers was all for arrogance – he possessed the quality in full measure himself, as he’d often been informed
         – but it had to be deserved, you had to have worked for it. Or at the very least, an ancestor had to have worked for it.
      
      
      Arrogance without cause, arrogance without achievement – or that mistook sheer luck for true achievement – was an abomination. Losers made everybody look bad. Worse, they made the whole
         thing – the great game that was life – appear arbitrary, almost meaningless. Their only use, Veppers had long since decided,
         was as examples to be held up to those who complained about their lack of status or money or control over their lives: look,
         if this idiot can achieve something, so can anybody, so can you. So stop whining about being exploited and work harder.
      
      
      Still, at least individual losers were quite obviously statistical freaks. You could allow for that, you could tolerate that,
         albeit with gritted teeth. What he would not have believed was that you could find an entire society – an entire civilisation – of losers who’d made it. And the Culture was exactly that.
